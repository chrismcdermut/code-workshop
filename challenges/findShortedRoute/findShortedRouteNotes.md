findShortedRoute Notes go here!

Remember: both BFS and DFS will eventually find a path if one exists. The difference between the two is:
BFS always finds the shortest path.
DFS usually uses less space

1. during our breadth-first search, we keep track of how we reached each node, and
2. after our breadth-first search reaches the end node, we use our object to backtrack from the recipient to the sender.
