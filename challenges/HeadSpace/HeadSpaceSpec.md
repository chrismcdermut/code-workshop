/*
You are running a classroom and suspect that some of your students are passing around the answer to a multiple-choice question disguised as a random note.

Your task is to write a function that, given a list of words and a note, finds and returns the word in the list that is scrambled inside the note, if any exists. If none exist, it returns the result "-" as a string. There will be at most one matching word. The letters don't need to be in order or next to each other. The letters cannot be reused.

Complexity analysis variables:

W = number of words in `words`
S = maximal length of each word or of the note
