deleteNode Notes go here!

I dont know about this statement: 'If there are pointers to the input node's original next node, those pointers now point to a "dangling" node (a node that's no longer reachable by walking down our list). In our example above, c is now dangling. If we changed c, we'd never encounter that new value by walking down our list from the head to the tail.'
